# House-Price-Prediction-MLR

# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**.  
It demonstrates a complete data science workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation, using Python.

The project was developed as part of an **academic data science assignment**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To analyze how multiple housing features affect house prices  
- To build a Multiple Linear Regression model  
- To interpret model results and evaluate performance  

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about houses, including several independent variables (features) related to house characteristics and one dependent variable (house price).

The dataset is explored and preprocessed before building the regression model.

---

## 🧪 Methodology
The project follows these main steps:

1. Data loading and understanding  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Data preprocessing  
4. Model training using Multiple Linear Regression  
5. Model evaluation and interpretation  

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The performance of the regression model is evaluated using:

- **R² Score** – measures how well the model explains the variation in house prices  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – measures the average prediction error  

These metrics help assess the accuracy and reliability of the model.
